A simple scolling implementation of pacman - to learn how to implement Dijaktra's Alrorithm.

Instructions:

Scroll the maze using the arrow keys and click on a point in the maze to force all Ghosts to find their way to that position.

Move 'Pacman' using 'W','A','S' & 'D' keys.


This is an early implemntation and most of the game logic is missing. Dijaktra's algorithm is working nicely though.
